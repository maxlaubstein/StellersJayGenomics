This directory contains all code used to run and plot the results of ADMIXTURE (Alexander et al., 2009).  
Admixture was run using a dataset of 7243417 SNPs pruned for linkage disequilibrium.
Admixture was run for K values from 2 through 10.  Cross validation error supports K = 6 as the best-fitting subpopulation scheme.
