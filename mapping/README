This directory contains the code I've used to make the base maps in sampling, admixture, and other maps.
Generally, this process entails: 
- Retrieving a shapefile for the area of interest
- Downloading elevation data from within the confines of the shapefile
- Calculating slope and aspect to create a "shaded" effect
- Plotting semi-transparent elevation raster over "hillshaded" layer to create a shaded relief map
